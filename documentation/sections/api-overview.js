    <p>Fiona has a jQuery like plugin architecture where methods are attached to <code>fiona.fn</code> to operate on an instance, and directly on <code>fiona</code> when used as utility.</p>
    <p>For demonstration purposes, a seed of <code>24</code> is used, but changing this should render different, but consistent results.</p>
